 After_flow creation is a social enterprise that wants to make a movement towards environmentally and socially better fashion production practices. 

 The initiative is at an early stage, where they are just starting out and networking with fashion brands, searching for new collaborations, so the portfolio is also continuously growing bigger.

  We were interested to help After_flow with a web solution because we love their initiative. The reason why their initiative was so appealing to us is that we truly believe that upcycling is the future and the people behind After_flow. Even after a small chat, we realized how passionate and driven the founders of the brand were and we would like to see them grow bigger. For them to reach bigger audiences, they need to present themselves better online and this is where we can come in and help out.
