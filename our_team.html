              “From times of my childhood, I always dreamt to create beautiful
              and practical clothes and outfits.” We met Nataliia in May this
              year and instantly fell in love with her creativity, drive and
              passion for her work. We included Nataliia in our team as the head
              tailor and designer. Her unique set of skills, knowledge and more
              than 10 years of experience in the fashion industry is precious
              and we are incredibly grateful she likes our initiative and wants
              to be part of it. Nataliia and her 2-year-old daughter had to
              leave her home and family in Ukraine due to the war. “The war
              brought a new reality and now I am here with a new page in my
              life.” She keeps being positive and we feel privileged to be able
              to offer her a platform where she can continue realizing her
              professional dreams.

              Tatiana was born and raised in Kharkov, Ukraine, which was
              completely devastated earlier this year by the Russian army, so
              she decided to leave for Denmark with her daughter. Despite the
              sad reality, she is very creative, cheerful, and full of energy.
              Back home, she worked as a fashion designer, tailor and
              seamstress, and in her free time she really enjoys making
              beautiful teddy bears for children. We are more than happy to have
              Tatiana join our team, where she has already designed and sewed
              some enchanting pieces out of textile waste. As she says herself
              “creating something new together is always interesting and I
              believe that it is promising”`
